# Authentication

Welcome to the authentication section of the Método Logística API. To protect your data and ensure the security of our operations, authentication is a fundamental requirement for accessing our API.

To authenticate, you must use an access token. This token is used in your requests to the API and is essential to ensure that only authorized users have access to the corresponding information and operations.

In this section, we will provide you with all the necessary information to generate and use your token. Let's get started!

### Bearer Token

To access the Método Logística API, you must use your access token (Bearer Token) included in the authorization header of your requests, which you can find in the "API settings" section in your client panel. Below we will show you how to add the token to the request header using cURL:

```bash Example request using Bearer Token
curl $base_url/api/v1/orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```
Always keep your token secure and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised. We recommend taking additional measures to protect your token and ensure the integrity of your account.
